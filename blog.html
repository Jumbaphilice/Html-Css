	<h1> LOVE</h1>
	<p>Love is the way we live with one another and how we treat them. it encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states  . Love is as critical for your mind . It's not negotiable. The more connected you are, the healthier you will be both physically and emotionally. The less connected you are, the more you are at risk of getting depressed and living unhappy life.</p>
	<p>It is also true that the less love you have towards others, the less you are likely to experience in your life. Love is probably the best of all because it is out of love we can enjoy the company of each other and live peacefully. Life without hatred and pride.</p>
	<p>Depression is feeling unloved. Most depressed people don't love themselves and they do not feel loved by others. They are very self-focused, making them less attractive to others and depriving them of opportunities to learn the skills of love.</p> 
	<p>People in our culture always believe that love just happens. As result, the depressed often sit around passively waiting for someone to hold their hand, comfort and love them. But most of the time it doesn’t work because love doesn’t operate that way. To get love and keep love you have to go out and be active and learn a variety of specific knowledge on how to love.</p>
	<p>Most of us get our ideas of love from popular culture. We come to believe that love is something that sweeps us off our feet. But the pop-culture ideal of love consists of unrealistic images created for entertainment, which is one reason so many of us are set up to be depressed Its part of our national vulnerability, like eating junk food, constantly stimulated by images of instant gratification. We think it is love when it's simply distraction and infatuation.</p>
	<p>One consequence is that when we hit real love we become upset and disappointed because there are many things that do not fit the cultural ideal. Some of us get demanding and controlling, wanting someone else to do what we think our ideal of romance should be, without realizing our ideal is misplaced.</p>
 	<p>Love is a learned skill, not something that comes from hormones or emotion particularly. Erich Fromm called it "an act of will. “If you don't learn the skills of love you virtually guarantee that you will be depressed, not only because you will not be connected enough but because you will have many failure experiences due to lack of cooperation and togetherness.as we all know where there is love,there will be alot of chaos and misunderstanding hence you will not be able to learn from each other.</p>
 	<p>Communication is also important. How we interact with each other on our daily basis always show the care you have for the person you are talking too. We should always try and use polite words not to intimidate the other personal.it is very important to learn communication skills because it will help us I having a good relationship with each other</p>
	<p>Recognize that the internal voice is strong but it's not real. Talkback to it. "I'm not really being rejected, this isn't really evidence of inadequacy. I made a mistake." Or "this isn't about me, this is something I just didn't know how to do and now I'll learn." When you reframe this situation to something more adequate, you can act again in an effective way and you can find and keep the love that you need.</p>
